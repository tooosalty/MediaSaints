# MediaSaints #
As part of an internship, I collaborated on a redesign of the MediaSaints website, aiming to improve user experience and visual appeal. I created mockups in Figma to present a modernized site layout, with enhanced navigation, accessibility, and alignment with brand goals. This project focused on optimizing user flow and was developed through iterative feedback sessions with the team.

Technologies Used: Figma
